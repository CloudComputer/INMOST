INMOST is a software platform for development of parallel numerical models on general meshes

INMOST (Integrated Numerical Modelling and Object-oriented
Supercomputing Technologies) is a supplimentary tool for supercomputer numerical mathematical models
characterized by a maximum generality of supported computational meshes,
distributed data structure flexibility and cost-effectiveness, as well as cross
platform portability.
