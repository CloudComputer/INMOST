INMOST
======

INMOST is a software platform for development of parallel numerical models on general meshes

The presented toolkit may be usefull in creation of parallel software
MPI-platforms for developing parallel numerical models on general meshes.
Technology complex INMOST (Integrated Numerical Modelling and Object-oriented
Supercomputing Technologies) is a tool for supercomputer simulations
characterized by a maximum generality of supported computational meshes,
distributed data structure flexibility and cost-effectiveness, as well as cross
platform portability.
